As soon as you open the console, this is what you will see. The console will ask for the first players name.  
#### Using the Application
![Second Player](./assets/players.png)  
After the user inputs their name, it asks for the second players name. 
In this case, the first player is named Mochi and the second player is named Kudo

The way the users input their desired spot is by entering the number of the corresponding positon they wish to mark.

In the prior photo, we saw that Mochi chose position 5. After he chose and pressed enter, the corresponding area shows his "X" mark.
